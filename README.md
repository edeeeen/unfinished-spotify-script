# unfinished-spotify-script
This originally was going to be a Spotify to Apple Music link converter in TamperMonkey, but I didn't find out Apple Music API costs 100/year until after I made all of this.  

Some of it could still be usable in the future for any other Spotify API stuff I do so I didn't want to just throw it away.  

Also theres a python script for getting an access token because I was struggling to do it with JS
